## Project Structure



---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is **ignored by Git**):

EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_appwrite_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=metrics


---

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

npm install


### Start the development server

npx expo start


You can run the app using:
- Expo Go (Android)
- Android Emulator
- USB debugging (ADB reverse) for restricted networks

---

## Important Notes

- This project uses **Expo Router**, so there is **no `App.tsx`**
- Entry point is handled via:

import 'expo-router/entry';

- Appwrite uses **region-specific endpoints**
- `.env` must never be committed

---

## Planned Improvements

- Authentication
- Watchlist / saved movies
- Skeleton loaders
- Better error handling
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements
- Production builds
